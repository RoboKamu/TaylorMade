# TIELA2_projekt
Second year electrical engineering project.
>Insert amazing professional documentation here

## Phase 1 (simplest)
### App:

- MIT App Inventor

- Python Flask with GET/POST for communication with the app

- Data is stored and served as CSV (or JSON if easier), raw data

- (?) -> the app polls every 5 seconds for power usage and other data from the outlet

### Hardware/Firmware:
- ...

## Phase 2 (future development)
### App:

- Socket server (Python TCP) replaces HTTPS

- The app sends text commands (can be abstracted with button presses) to the Raspberry Pi

- The app displays clear data in the form of graphs and good data analysis from CSV

- Java Android App (Java + socket)
